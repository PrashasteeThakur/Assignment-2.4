1.Hadoop in layman’s term.
As we refer to big data we come across distributed computing. And with distributed computing comes the complexity of dealing with data transfer across network, bandwidth issues, etc. This is where hadoop comes into picture. In simple terms hadoop is used for efficient data management in distributed environment. Both the challenges of big data-storage and processing are handled by Hadoop.There are two components of Hadoop framework-HDFS(for big data storage and access) and MapReduce(for processing). Pig and Hive open source alternatives to Hadoop MapReduce were built so that hadoop developers could do the same thing in Java in a less verbose way by writing only fewer lines of code that is easy to understand.  Hive Hadoop Component is used mainly by data analysts whereas Pig Hadoop Component is generally used by Researchers and Programmers. 2) HiveHadoop Component is used for completely structured Data whereas Pig Hadoop Component is used for semi structured data.

2.The Hadoop framework consists of two components-
1.HDFS- Distributed File System, which allows data to be stored in an easily accessible format, across a large number of linked storage devices.Hadoop system uses its own file system which sits “above” the file system of the host computer – meaning it can be accessed using any computer running any supported OS).
2.MapReduce-MapReduce is named after the two basic operations this component carries out – reading data from the database, putting it into a format suitable for analysis (map), and performing mathematical operations i.e counting the number of males aged 30+ in a customer database (reduce).

3. Increasing pay for data analytics professionals
As the demand steadily increases and the supply remains low, data analytics professionals are getting paid more and more. In India, as it stands today, data analytics professionals are paid on average 50% more than their counterparts in other IT based professions. This trend is evident across the globe as more and more companies realize just how important these professionals are to the organization.According to Forbes, the median advertised salary for professionals with Big Data expertise is $124,000 a year.
4. Big data analytics is everywhere
Just as it has become imperative to use computers in today’s workplace, the use data analytics professionals to foster growth is slowly catching on. There is practically no sector which has remained untouched from the reach of Data Analytics.
5. You will be at the core of decision-making in the company
One of the leading causes of job place dissatisfaction is that most employees feel as if they do not have any decision-making power. They often feel like just another cog in the great corporate wheel. As a data analytics professional, you will be at the core of decision-making in your chosen company.
